# Mayumi_v4
Mayumi v4 PS1 Modchip. Often I find just modder to sell their chips and don't show how to programm them on your own.
Another annoying thing is the precompiled hex files for old chips.
So let's change this :)

# PIC Microcontroller
* Microchip PIC12F508 (newer version of PIC12C508)

# Tools needed
* PICkit 3
* SOP8 to DIP8 adapter (pitch: 1.27mm, often labled as "e")

# Connecting the PIC

* PICKit 1 ⟷ IC 4 (VPP)
* PICKit 2 ⟷ IC 1 (VDD)
* PICKit 3 ⟷ IC 8 (VSS)
* PICKit 4 ⟷ IC 7 (ICSPDAT)
* PICKit 5 ⟷ IC 6 (ICSPCLK)
